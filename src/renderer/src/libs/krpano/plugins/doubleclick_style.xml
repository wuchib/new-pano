		krpano 1.22
	
		Note - since version 1.22 the onsingleclick and ondoubleclick events are built-in!
		
		That means no extra code is required. This file here is only for compatibility
		and contains now an 'empty' doubleclick style. When updating old examples, the
		including of this file could be removed therefore.
		
		Example:
		
		<layer ...
		       style="doubleclick"
		       onsingleclick="trace('-single click-');"
		       ondoubleclick="trace('-double click-');"
		       />
	-->
	
	<style name="doubleclick" />
